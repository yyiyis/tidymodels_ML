ðŸŒ€ Workflow of Machine learning in R with package tidymodels

- Strength of tidymodels

- Basic usage

- For workflow or iteration



As we all know, there exist lots of machine learning methods or packages in R, FROM different authors. So huge different usage due to so many parameters in each function.

Fortunately, tidymodels union these packages!

Not only use it for machine learning, but also in prepare data (including split data set into training and test, impute missing values, one-hot coding, normalizeâ€¦etc.)
